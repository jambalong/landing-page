# Landing Page

This project is part of The Odin Project: [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) focusing on building a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS.

Live Demo: https://jambalong.com/landing-page/

## Assignment Overview

1. **Design Reference**: Download the design images and review them to understand what you’re going to create:

    - [Image One (Full Design)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)

    - [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)

    Notes:

    - The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.

    - Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

2. **Project Approach**: Tackle the project one section at a time. The website consists of 4 main sections (and a footer), so focus on getting one section into shape before moving to the next. Starting from the top is a good strategy.

3. **Content First**: Begin by adding all the content to the page before styling. Complete the HTML structure first, then apply the CSS. You may need to return to the HTML for adjustments while styling, but minimizing back-and-forth will streamline the process. (Note: Using a single stylesheet is sufficient for this project.)

4. **Reference Flexbox Exercises**: Many elements in this project are similar to those from the flexbox exercises. Feel free to revisit those resources for a refresher.

5. **Responsive Design**: There’s no need to make the project mobile-friendly at this stage; that will be covered later.

6. **Version Control**: Don’t forget to push your completed project to GitHub!
